## Usage

You can click on the website link above and pretty much it functions like a regular static website.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

I created the website in HTML and slowly by every section, I added CSS so that the website wouldn't break on me.

## Optimizations

There's no real need for optimizations. Of course the website can always look and be better, but it's just not in my top priority at the moment.
Some top of ideas I have is convert it into a React website and add a shopping cart, as well as a dynamic photo gallery.

## Lessons Learned:

This was one of the first websites I created and wow, it's been a long journey. This was the website that I experimented with a lot of things in CSS
and also experimented with media queries. I learned a lot about CSS when I created this website.
